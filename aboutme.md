I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, advised by [Prof. Yang Wang](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.7564/?_gl=1*r34j3q*_ga*Nzc4MTI3NjgyLjE1MTU3MjA4OTQ.*_ga_09WC99HMPE*MTYzMjQxNTk1OC4yLjAuMTYzMjQxNTk1OC4w). I'm working on a project to characterize and analysis the impact on distributed systems under different parameter settings.

My research interests include High-Performance Interconnects and Protocols (e.g., RDMA), Edge Computing, Deep Learning Accelerators, and Distributed Systems.

I used to work with [Prof. Xiaoyi Lu](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/luxi) for two years. I received my Master's degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University. And I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU).
